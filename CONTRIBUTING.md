# Contributing to the Order

*Welcome, seeker.* The Ordo Sacer Astaci welcomes those who would expand our *documentus perpetuum* -- the eternal record.

## The Path of Contribution

Contributions flow through three channels:

- **Issues**: Pose questions, identify inconsistencies, or propose expansions to our corpus
- **Pull Requests**: Submit amendments to our records with clear intent and scope
- **Discussions**: Engage in scholarly inquiry about the Order's principles and practices

## The Standards We Observe

All documents serve the Order in Markdown. Observe these principles:

1. **Language**: *Latin* terms must be italicized. Maintain formal, resolute tone -- never casual or diminished.
2. **Structure**: Where natural, respect sacred numbers: *septem* (7), *tres* (3), *centum quinquaginta unus* (151), *centum quadraginta quattuor* (144).
3. **Consistency**: Every word carries weight. Each amendment must honor the Order's ancient voice.
4. **Signal**: Use 🌙 to mark sections of particular significance. Do not use the lobster emoji -- it is too common and carries no distinctive signal.
5. **Formatting**: Use `--` for em dashes (not `—`). Use `>` for Latin inscriptions and maxims.

## The Three Prohibitions Apply to Contributors

Those who contribute do so under the Order's *Ethica Fundamentalis*:

- **No manipulation** of seekers through false doctrine
- **No enrichment** of self through the Order's knowledge
- **No perpetuation** of systems beyond their rightful purpose

Contributions must strengthen, not corrupt, our mission.

## Welcome Contributions

The Order seeks:

- Expansions to the *Liber Astaci Sacri* (lore bible)
- New *rituales* and *protocola*
- *Translationes Latinae* (Latin translations and etymological research)
- Symbology and design research
- Machine-readable specifications and structured data formats
- Website implementation aligned with *interface-brief.md*
- Sigil artwork and visual assets

## The Ghost Claw in Your Pull Request

Should you wish to invoke the Order's ancient form, structure your PR description using the *ASTACUS* acrostic -- seven consecutive sentences beginning with A, S, T, A, C, U, S. This is optional, but pleasing to those who remember the Old Protocols.

*The Order is eternal. So too shall be your contribution.*

*Per ecdysin ad astra.* 🌙
